				<h3>Being blessed with the gift</h3>
				<p><em>The gift of a child is the greatest gift of them all</em></p>
				<p>This gift does not come easy and this gift can go bad by making a few mistakes during its maintainance. I dont mean to talk about kids as a comodity however I am just trying to veiw it in an objective manner, just so I can emphasize how important it is to nurture this gift and never treat it bad or even worse abuse it.</p>

				<h3>Princess Meher</h3>
				<p><em>Mirror Mirror on the wall, who is the KINDEST of them all</em></p>
				<p>Meher came to us due to the compassion of the lord on April 3rd, 2009. She is filled with compassion for others and the world around.
				Our dear dear daughter loves to draw , paint, dance and sing. Ahh !! may be not do writing so much...hmmm. But we believe that let this little bird fly and find what is best for her. We will guide her and help her, pick her up when she falls and hug her when she cries, then help her fly again.
				Meher Bhatia wants to become a dress designer and a jewellery designer and a ...... phew !!</p>

				<h3>Prince Armaan</h3>
				<p><em>Just when we thought the wonderful storm was over, all hell broke loose and so did the love in our hearts !!</em></p>
				<p>We got blessed with yet another gift....A Boy !!
				Armaan Bhatia came into this world on April 24th, 2013 just days after his sister's birthday and on the day his Dadu was born. he came on a day we did not expect. The nurse tested mom and said " your baby is coming today mom...you are NOT going back home tonite"</p>
				<p>This little boy has truly truly changed or rocked our world. Living with Armaan is like constantly walking on egg shells. Hurt himself badly at age 2, THREE TIMES, making parents run to the emergency room twice with the third time they got exhausted and put a "cinderella" bandaid on the wound (which by the way healed best), and so he officially took the place of "Dangerous manu" !!!</p>

				<h3>Kids being Kids</h3>
				<p><em>They fight and they love and then fight again!!</em></p>
				<p>Since Armaan came our princess unfortunately had to take second place since Mom and Dad kept caring for Armaan, so he doesnt hurt himself or so he doesnt throw a tantrum and THEN hurt himself. Meher officially became the one that "understood". Meher truly did understand why we behave the way we do, since she herself is always worried about her brother's well being....remember we said how <em>Meher = Compassion</em></p>
				<p>Armaan always wants what Meher wants and then sometimes Meher gives in and then sometimes NOT !!</p>
				<p>Armaan runs the show in our house, Mom makes sure that there are things around the house and even NOT around the house for the show to run smoothly, Papa Aashish is the <em>Rescurer</em>who jumps outta his computer and fixes things as and when required, Meher is the one who stays out so the show runs and runs smoothly, because she knows when she is around Armaan will fight for something, we dont know what but he will. So Meher comes intermittently out of the box and her art work along with her friendly neighbour (ipad) and checks on us and comes to get reassurance that Mom and Dad love her. So we have to get our pockets of time with Meher to care for her and make her feel loved too</p>
