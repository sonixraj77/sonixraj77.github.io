		<h2>About Us</h2>
		<p>We are a family of four. Our life is a super fast moving journey. We fall and we stand up. We fail and we learn however most importantly we try to stay happy. The motto of our life is "staying happy and being kind", no matter what life throws at us. We four have come together after going through very trying times and god has chosen to bring us together and we value this gift and will protect it in the envelope of love, compassion and prayer !!
		We are not prefect parents nor are our kids the perfect kids. We get lazy and we let some behaviours as parents go, yet try our best to be the best. 
		We beleive that life may have several set backs but every set back is really a set up...by God !!</p>
