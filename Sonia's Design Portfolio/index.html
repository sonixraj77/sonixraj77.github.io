		<h3>Hello!!!</h3>
		<p>I am Sonia Bhatia and I hope to pursue a career in User Experience Design. Designing and finding ways to make stuff work in a more easy and seamless manner is my passion. A Architect from Mumbai, India I have worked in the U.S for 5 years before taking a break to have kids, never the less I did not stop designing and enhancing my skill sets. I worked on a free-lance basis for my project manager, passed my LEED,AP exam for creating green and clean building designs along with learning marketing skills from U.C Berkeley, Ext. It is during this time that I learnt more about User experience design/Interaction design and got interested in learning more about it. I started off with learning HTML/CSS to understand website design and took a workshop in JavaScript and JQuery to further help me with my websites.<br> 
		I have started designing my own websites and decided to do my presentation in HTML and CSS for it is something I have learnt recently and only made sense for me to put it into use immediately. This presentation is my attempt at creating a good user experience !
